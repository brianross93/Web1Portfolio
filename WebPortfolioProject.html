       Hello! My name is Brian Ross. I am a student at Make School learning Applied Computer Science, and I 
       am enjoying the experience! This is a portfolio page that I've made for my class, but I'll take the time to share some things 
       about me. First of all, I am an excellent chef - I just started last week and I haven't burned anything.
    I also enjoy chess, educational youtube videos, and learning in general.
       Creating this portfolio is certainly a learning experience! 
   </p>
